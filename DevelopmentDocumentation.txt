Development Documentation


Javadocs are used to generate API documentation for your Java project. It provides a way to document your code and its functionality. To generate Javadocs, you can use the `javadoc` command-line tool or integrate it into your build process using build tools like Maven or Gradle.

Source Code Directory Structure
The source code directory structure organizes your project's source code files. Here is a common directory structure for a Java project:

- `src/main/java`: Contains the main Java source code files.
- `src/main/resources`: Contains resources like configuration files, property files, etc.
- `src/test/java`: Contains the test Java source code files.
- `src/test/resources`: Contains resources for testing.

Build Process
To compile your Java project, you can use build tools like Maven or Gradle. These build tools automate the build process and manage dependencies. Here are the general steps to compile a Java project:

1. Install the build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle) if not already installed.
2. Define the project configuration file (`pom.xml` for Maven or `build.gradle` for Gradle) with the necessary dependencies and build settings.
3. Run the build command (`mvn compile` for Maven or `gradle build` for Gradle) in the project's root directory.
4. The build tool will compile the source code and generate the output files (e.g., `.class` files) in the appropriate directories.

Compiler Time Dependencies
Compiler time dependencies are the libraries or modules required by your project during the compilation process. These dependencies are specified in the project configuration file (`pom.xml` for Maven or `build.gradle` for Gradle). The build tool will automatically download and include these dependencies during the build process.

Development Standards
Development standards define the coding conventions, best practices, and guidelines to be followed during the development process. These standards ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase. It is recommended to document and communicate the development standards to the development team. Some common development standards include naming conventions, code formatting, documentation requirements, and version control practices.

Setting up a Database for Development
To set up a database for development, follow these steps:

1. Install a database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite) on your development machine.
2. Create a new database for your project.
3. Configure the database connection settings in your project's configuration file (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`).
4. Use a database migration tool (e.g., Flyway or Liquibase) to manage database schema changes and versioning.

Getting the Source Code from the Repository
To get the source code from the repository, follow these steps:

1. Install a version control system client (e.g., Git) on your development machine.
2. Clone the repository using the repository URL and the Git clone command (`git clone <repository_url>`).
3. Switch to the desired branch or commit using the Git checkout command (`git checkout <branch_or_commit>`).
4. The source code will be downloaded to your local machine, and you can start working on it.
